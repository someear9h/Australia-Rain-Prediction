# Australia-Rain-Prediction
machine learning models to predict the rain in Australian regions
Australian Rain Prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict rainfall in various Australian cities. The model uses historical weather data to determine the likelihood of rain on the following day, based on multiple features like temperature, humidity, and location.

Dataset
The data is sourced from the Australian Rain Prediction dataset on Kaggle. The dataset includes weather observations across multiple Australian locations and spans several years. Relevant features include:

Location: City name (e.g., Sydney, Melbourne, etc.)
Date: The specific day for each weather record
Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, etc.
RainToday: Boolean indicating if it rained on the current day
RainTomorrow: Target variable indicating if rain is expected the following day
The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values, normalizing numerical features, and encoding categorical features.

Model
The model used for this project is a Logistic Regression classifier. It has been trained on the historical weather data and provides a binary prediction (Yes or No) indicating if it will rain the next day.

Setup and Usage
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn joblib opendatasets
Download the Dataset: The script will automatically download the dataset from Kaggle using opendatasets and save it locally.

Train the Model (if not using the provided model): You can train the model by loading and preparing the data, then running the training script. After training, save the model as aussie_rain_model.joblib.

Run Predictions: Load the saved model and input the necessary weather details (e.g., temperature, humidity, location) to receive a rain prediction.

File Details
aussie_rain.joblib: The trained model saved as a joblib file for easy loading.
Predicting Rain in Australia.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing code for loading data, preprocessing, training the model, and making predictions.
Future Enhancements
Implement more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
Improve input data validation and expand the model to include seasonal trends
Add visualizations for weather trends in Australian cities
